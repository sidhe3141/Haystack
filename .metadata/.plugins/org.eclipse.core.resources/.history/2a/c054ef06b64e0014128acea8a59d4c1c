        <title>Haystack: Bury your Browsing</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">What is Haystack?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="t1">Haystack</span> is a website that protects your browsing from Facebook, Google, and other sites that might make
    		use of it, such as by targeting ads or identifying correlations in your history.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">How Does It Work?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Haystack opens frames in this very page, that bury your browsing beneath a large amount of noise. By doing this, it becomes 
    		difficult for advertisers, tracking cookies, traffic sniffers, and other methods of tracking you online to know what you're 
    		actually looking at. Haystack opens a new frame containing a site of your choice, and clicks random links on that site at random
    		intervals, to create the appearance of an actual user visiting that site.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">What Should I Be Concerned About?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				First, <span class="t1">Haystack does not conceal or anonomyze your activity.</span> Sites you visit, even with Haystack 
    				active, still know that you have visited them, and anyone specifically watching for those sites will know that you 
    				have visited them. If you wish to visit a site anonymously, please use a proxy or an onion-routing service such as Tor. 
    				<span class="t2">By using Haystack, you agree that you understand that you are not anonymous.</span>
    				
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Second, <span class="t1">Haystack does not know your data.</span> It cannot log in or register at any site, nor can it 
    				replicate user activity. Haystack does not offer deniability on fora, online games, discussion boards, or any
    				other kind of site that makes use of any activity other than clicking links. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you 
    				agree that you do not expect it to perform anything more sophisticated than clicking random links.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Third, <span class="t1">Haystack generates false clicks.</span>. Before using Haystack, please blacklist any sites you 
    				operate containing advertisements, in order to remain in compliance with the law. It is also suggested that you blacklist 
    				any sites on which it is likely that you have advertisements, or on which it is possible that your computer might 
    				automatically fill in information to make purchases. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you agree to take reasonable 
    				precautions such as these to prevent it from making any false clicks which might benefit you, and accept any false clicks 
    				it makes which harm you. You further agree that you will not hold any person liable for any direct or indirect result of
    				any false click.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Fourth, <span class="t1">Haystack does not change what is visible to you.</span> Haystack is only useful to hide activity
    				from external tracking. It does not hide your browsing from anyone looking over your shoulder or passing your cube while 
    				you are away, nor from most spyware or keyloggers that might be installed on your computer. This also extends to your 
    				stored browsing history; depending on your browser, Haystack's sites might not appear in your history. <span class="t2">
    				By using Haystack, you accept that your activity is not hidden from anyone with access to your machine.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Fifth, <span class="t1">Haystack does not protect you from malware.</span> Haystack visits sites largely at random, and 
    				has no way to distinguish good sites from bad. It will run any scripts found on any site it visits. It is suggested that 
    				before using Haystack, you ensure that your firewall and security software are up to date (or run Haystack in a virtual 
    				box or on a separate machine), and blacklist extensions such as "*.exe". Do not under any circumstances save to your 
    				computer anything opened by Haystack. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you accept the possibility that it might 
    				inadvertently damage your computer, and agree that you will not hold any person other than the creator of any malware 
    				liable for any damage to your computer caused directly or indirectly by Haystack's operation.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>Sixth, <span class="t1">Haystack uses your Internet connection.</span> All sites Haystack opens are opened as though you
    				had opened them. Data rates may apply if you are using Haystack on a smartphone, and sites it opens count against any
    				bandwidth or data limits on a network connection. If Haystack opens a site that is on an NSA watchlist or the like, 
    				anyone watching your traffic will most likely have no way of knowing it was Haystack that opened it. As such, take care 
    				when using Haystack. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you accept that it may slow down other network operations,
    				incur data or other usage fees, or access or attempt to access sites that are forbidden, illegal, suspicious, 
    				unproductive, pornographic, or otherwise prone to cause negative consequences for you. You agree that you shall not hold 
    				any other person liable for your lost productivity, fees, investigation, arrest, job termination, or any similar negative 
    				consequence resulting from your use of Haystack.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Seventh, like all privacy tools, <span class="t1">Haystack might be used to cover up criminal activity.</span> This is an
    				unavoidable consequence of any tool that hides activity or provides deniability. The creator does not condone any illegal 
    				use of Haystack, nor any use of Haystack to conceal crimes, but it is impossible to design any privacy tool such that it 
    				cannot be used for these. Because of this limitation, it is possible that Haystack specifically, or similar tools 
    				generally, might become illegal or suspect to use in some jurisdictions. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you agree 
    				that its use is legal where you are using it, and that you will neither commit any crime nor inflict any tort with it, 
    				nor by any activity concealed by its use. Should you commit a crime or inflict a tort by use of Haystack, or by an action 
    				concealed by Haystack, you agree that you have done so by your own free will; and that its creator was blameless in your 
    				doing so, and was neither accomplice nor accessory nor conspirator to your act.</span>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Eighth, <span class="t1">Haystack is experimental.</span> It might have bugs that are not currently known, or might be 
    				exploitable in ways that its creator cannot anticipate. <span class="t2">By using Haystack, you accept that it is in 
    				development, and might be prone to unpredicted and/or exploitable behavior. You agree that you will not hold any person 
    				liable for any such behavior who did not intentionally produce such behavior. You accept that it is presented as-is. 
    				You agree that you will not hold any person liable for any injury (physical, financial, or otherwise) resulting from your own
    				use of Haystack in any unusual or sensitive application, including but not limited to: espionage, operation of any heavy 
    				machinery, monitoring of any person or thing, operation of nuclear or other power plants, or secure communication.</span>
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">How do I use Haystack?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Good question! You use Haystack like this:
    		<ol>
    			<li>
    				<span class="t1">Create your Blacklist.</span> Your Blacklist contains sites that Haystack will stop at and return 
    				to a default page instead of clicking through. Each item on your Blacklist is a <span class="t3">regular expression:
    				</span> a string of characters describing a test that is applied to the address visited. The Blacklist is used to avoid
    				accidentally committing "click fraud" by producing clicks on a site on which you host ads. To add an item to the 
    				Blacklist, do this:
    				<ol>
    					<li>
    						<span class="t1">Enter the regular expresion.</span> Type in a regular expression in the "Regex" field that can apply to a site address.
    						For instance, to avoid accidentally clicking on your own ads, you might enter "*yourname*". To avoid running possibly 
    						malicious programs, you might enter "*.exe".
    					</li>
    					<li>
    						<span class="t1">Enter the list name.</span> If you want to save this Blacklist item for later use, type a word in
    						the "List" field. For instance, you might type "security" for items that keep your computer from visiting malicious sites, 
    						or your name for items that keep you from visiting sites you own.
    					</li>
    					<li>
    						<span class="t1">Click the appropriate "Add" button.</span> If you want the Blacklist item to apply to the current 
    						session only, click "Add Local". If you want the Blacklist item to apply to future sessions, click "Add Global".
    						Note that "Add Global" installs a cookie used for storing the Blacklist item, and does not transfer the item across 
    						different machines.
    					</li>
    				</ol>
    				If you want to add more than one Blacklist item at a time, you should enter all of them into a saved Blacklist, using 
    				"Add Global" above. Later, you can load them by typing the list name you used into the "List" field, and clicking "Load List".
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<span class="t1">Choose your Default Address.</span> Your Default Address is the address your 
    			</li>
    		</ol>
