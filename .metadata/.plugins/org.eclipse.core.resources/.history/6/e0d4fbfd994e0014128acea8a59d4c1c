        <title>Haystack: Bury your Browsing</title>
    </head>

    		<span class="h1">What is Haystack?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="t1">Haystack</span> is a website that protects your browsing from Facebook, Google, and other sites that might make
    		use of it.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">How Does It Work?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Haystack opens frames in this very page, that bury your browsing beneath a large amount of noise. By doing this, it becomes 
    		difficult for advertisers, tracking cookies, traffic sniffers, and other methods of tracking you online to know what you're 
    		actually looking at. Haystack opens a new frame containing a site of your choice, and clicks random links on that site at random
    		intervals, to create the appearance of an actual user visiting that site.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<span class="h1">What Should I Be Concerned About?</span>
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				First, <span class="t1">Haystack does not conceal or anonomyze your activity.</span> Sites you visit, even with Haystack 
    				active, still know that you have visited them, and anyone specifically watching for those sites will know that you 
    				have visited them. If you wish to visit a site anonymously, please use a proxy or an onion-routing service such as Tor.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Second, <span class="t1">Haystack does not know your data.</span> It cannot log in or register at any site, nor can it 
    				replicate user activity. Haystack does not offer deniability on fora, online games, discussion boards, or any
    				other kind of site that makes use of any activity other than clicking links.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Third, <span class="t1">Haystack generates false clicks.</span>. Before using Haystack, please blacklist any sites you 
    				operate containing advertisements, in order to remain in compliance with the law. It is also suggested that you blacklist 
    				any sites on which it is likely that you have advertisements.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Fourth, <span class="t1">Haystack does not change what is visible to you.</span> Haystack is only useful to hide activity
    				from external tracking. It does not hide your browsing from anyone looking over your shoulder or passing your cube while 
    				you are away, nor from most spyware or keyloggers installed on your computer.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Fifth, <span class="t1">Haystack does not protect you from malware.</span> Haystack visits sites largely at random, and 
    				has no way to distinguish good sites from bad. It will run any scripts found on any site it visits. It is suggested that 
    				before using Haystack, you ensure that your firewall and security software are up to date (or run Haystack in a virtual 
    				box or on a separate machine), and blacklist extensions such as "*.exe". Do not under any circumstances save to your 
    				computer anything opened by Haystack.
    			</li>
    			<li>Sixth, <span class="t1">Haystack uses your Internet connection.</span> All sites Haystack opens are opened as though you
    				had opened them. Data rates may apply if you are using Haystack on a smartphone, and sites it opens count against any
    				bandwidth or data limits on a network connection. If Haystack opens a site that is on an NSA watchlist or the like, 
    				anyone watching your traffic will most likely have no way of knowing it was Haystack that opened it. As such, take care 
    				when using Haystack.
    			</li>
